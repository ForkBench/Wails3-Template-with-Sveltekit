# Wails3 x SvelteKit Template

Hi ! This is a template for a Wails3 application with a SvelteKit frontend.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `wails3 build` to build the Go backend
3. Change all the `/build` configurations to match your project name and your name

## How to run

Just run `wails3 dev` and the application will start in development mode.

## How to build

Run `wails3 build` to build the Go backend and it will run by itself `npm run build`.

## Development

Note : I have added a `$core` alias to the bindings, so you can access the core functions from the frontend easily.
